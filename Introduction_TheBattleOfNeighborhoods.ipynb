    "## Introduction:\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people in making a smart and efficient decision on choosing excellent neighborhoods out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people are migrating to many different states of Canada and need a lot of research for sound housing prices and reputed schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Supermarket, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like-minded people, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project intends to create an analysis of features for people who are migrating to Scarborough in search of the best neighborhood as a relative analysis between neighborhoods. The highlights include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for an emergency, water resources both fresh and wastewater and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities."

    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to examine neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: a k-means clustering algorithm"
